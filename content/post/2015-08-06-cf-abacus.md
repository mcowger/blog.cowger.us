Yesterday I had the privilege of attending the inception meeting for the newest incubated Cloud Foundry project - [Abacus](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-abacus).

If you haven't looked at it, the short version is that its a service usage and metering tool for Cloud Foundry services, so we can go a bit further than the 'all or nothing' method that we have today.  Services can submit usage data to a CF instance, have it rated and billed as appropriate.

Even more interesting, this is mostly the same as the metering engine that IBM uses in their [Bluemix](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CC8QFjAAahUKEwiUyenpsJXHAhVCLogKHSMSCPg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.ng.bluemix.net%2F&ei=_s7DVZTSHMLcoASjpKDADw&usg=AFQjCNFLRWzUT34QaQZKbmqYXaHwVhV2Ag&sig2=iQVZhInzrw2rTOanv01ENg&bvm=bv.99804247,d.cGU) cloud, with a few modifications.

So, I've never done one of these meetings, but I was super happy with how it went.  We had people from IBM, Pivotal, Fujitsu, Nurego and SAP there...for a cross vendor meeting, there was a refreshing and impressive lack of argument or advertisement.

Led by a facilitator from Pivotal, the team was able to establish an early set of goals led by [Dr. Max](http://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-maxim).  I will leave it to Max to publish that stuff, but I was happy with the outcome.

According to the IBM team, its ready to run today, so [give it a shot.](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-abacus).
