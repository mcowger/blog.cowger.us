I've had a number of requests lately from friends and colleagues on how to get started with these ideas, and what they can read.   I recently rewrote that email for like the 10th time, so here it is in blog post form:

I think you need to be able to come from where your customers come from…and that means I think you need to learn to write code….the primary challenges in the DevOps and cloud native world are around deploying, managing and maintaining code, and there’s no way to really understand whats happening with platforms, containers, CI/CD, DevOps without understanding the basics of the code pipeline.

I’d start by learning python, just because its easy to understand, easy to run and supported by every tool out there…I like [‘Automate the Boring Stuff](http://automatetheboringstuff.com)’.   Some also prefer [‘Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org)’ as it adds more theory.    You should expect to spend at least a weeks worth of work on this….we are here for you if you get stuck.

From there, its on to Agile, which forms the basis for DevOps and modern application development and management.  Read the ‘[Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)’  to get a feeling for the reasoning and ideas behind why things are different followed by [‘The Phoenix Project](https://smile.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592?sa-no-redirect=1https://smile.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592?sa-no-redirect=1)’ for how this looks in a real company, and then the [‘DevOps Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations-ebook/dp/B01M9ASFQ3/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1490296319&sr=8-2&keywords=phoenix+project)’ for ‘how’ to do it:

With the theory for \***why**\* under your belt, you can start learning about containers and microservices.  [The Docker Book](https://www.dockerbook.com/) is a good as is [Docker up and Running](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920036142.dohttp://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920036142.do)   However, there’s no replacement for actually doing, so get docker installed on your laptop and play around.  Follow the[ Docker tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/get-started) .  Make sure you really follow the WHOLE thing and understand WHY you do each step.

Now you can move on to platforms – follow the [Cloud Foundry tutorial](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html) on deploying an application.   There are also [great free community courses](https://cloudfoundry.org/community-courses/)  … the first 2 are especially relevant.

Without the framework to understand the problems, you won’t be abler to interact with people beyond a 101 level.  I cannot stress enough the coding part….I know what you are thinking; “I’m not a developer”…and you aren’t.  But you are going to be working with developers and people with developer mindsets, and you can’t understand their problems without walking in their shoes for at least a mile.

Have fun!
