This is just a quick post in case you missed it like I did.  The VNX team has just published a new version of document `h8229`, better known as the vSphere VNX Techbook - the bible of using VNX with vSphere.

There's a ton of new content in there around best practices for vSphere 5.5 and VNX2.  Special consideration to:

* UNMAP (p. 70)
* iSCSI configuration (p. 43)
* SSD Pools (p. 58)
* NFS resiliency (p. 98)

Check it out (this link always bring you to the latest): [http://www.emc.com/collateral/hardware/technical-documentation/h8229-vnx-vmware-tb.pdf](http://www.emc.com/collateral/hardware/technical-
