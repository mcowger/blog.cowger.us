So, yet again, EMCworld is coming up, and I'll be at the show.

##What I'm Doing

This year, I don't have a session in which I'll be presenting, but I will be working the 'App Agility' booth with [Tyler Britten ](https://twitter.com/vmtyler) and [Drew Dimmick](https://twitter.com/drewdimmick).  We'll be showing off a fully opensource application that Tyler and I wrote using all of the 12-factor principles, running on [Cloud Foundry](http://cloudfoundry.org/index.html) (via [Pivotal Web Services](http://run.pivotal.io/)) and doing live, on-dmand, no-net code changes and pushing them live to the cloud on request from customers.  Wan't to request a change and see how easy/agile CF makes software deployment/development?  Besides - it involves grabbing images from live twitter streams, so you could end up with some blurred out NSFW images...the *scandal!*. Don't tell marketing or PR. Come by!

### Recommended Sessions

There's always good sessions, but I thought I'd collect my list of top sessions right here.

##ScaleIO
  * If you want to really understand ScaleIO, you need to listen to the session from their CTO, Erez Webman.  Erez is no CTO-in-name-only - he wrote much of the core code.  Erez is really smart, and I love ~~arguing~~ discussing with him some of the intracacies of caching, etc.  He and I don't always agree, but he's unbelievably smart and you should hit this session.  /ScaleIO Architecture/ on Tuesday at noon or Wednesday at 4:30.
  * ScaleIO also has a Hands On Lab thats very good.  Go do that.
  * There are also 2 really huge announcements coming about ScaleIO that you wont be able to miss at the show.


##VMAX
  * VMAX3 Performance: How To Trick Out Your VMAX3 For Optimal Performance - John Lynch presents this, and its very impressive and highly technical.  If you want to wring every last inch out of your VMAX3, this is the session.
  * VMAX Ask The Experts: Didn't get enough at John's presentation?  Go hear to ask even more stupidly smart people.  


##VNX/VNXe
  * Want to see the future of the VNX line?  Look no further than the VNXe3200.  Want to try the VNXe3200 (which will be the first to support VVOLs)?  Try the [HoL:](https://www.emcworldonline.com/2015/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1892)
  * [Hybrid Flash Deep Dive](https://www.emcworldonline.com/2015/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1623) will be really good too.
  * [Virtual VNX Overview.](https://www.emcworldonline.com/2015/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1620)  (wait, whats a virtual VNX?  Maybe this is a small leak of a major announcement?)

##XtremIO
  * [Itzik Reich's presentation](https://www.emcworldonline.com/2015/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1652) on running workloads on XtremIO will be killer, as usual.  
  * Want to see whats coming for XtremIO 4.0?  [Right here, baby](https://www.emcworldonline.com/2015/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1646).


##ViPR Controller
  * First - there is a big, giant announcement coming here.  Watch for it.
  * Want to actually see how ViPR makes storage management easier - do the [Hands On Lab](https://www.emcworldonline.com/2015/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1894)
  * Also, [an overview](https://www.emcworldonline.com/2015/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1526).
  * Wanna [do it with OpenStack?  Right here.](https://www.emcworldonline.com/2015/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1493)


## VSPEX Blue / EVO:RAIL
  * Yes we have a VSPEX Blue appliance.  [Learn here.](https://www.emcworldonline.com/2015/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1453)
  * ...and [play with it here](https://www.emcworldonline.com/2015/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1913)


## CloudArray
* Cloud Array was part of our TwinStrata acquisition, and does some cool tiering of filesystems / block devices to public/private clouds.  It takes like 20 minutes to setup too. [Check it out.](https://www.emcworldonline.com/2015/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1615)

## RecoverPoint

* RP is becoming more and more central to EMC's replication strategy, [so you should think about it. ](https://www.emcworldonline.com/2015/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1672)

## DevOps

* [DevOps is a reorg, not a toolset.](https://www.emcworldonline.com/2015/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1558)  Yes, thats true.  


## Cloud/PaaS

* Personal Opinion: IaaS is nothing but a gateway to what you really want, which is a PaaS (and I'd argue that PaaS should be CloudFoundry).  [Some good thoughts on how to get there.](https://www.emcworldonline.com/2015/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1916)


# ECS / Object Storage

* Object storage is easy to use, cheap as *f*\*\** and dense.  [ECS is a good way to provide it internally.](https://www.emcworldonline.com/2015/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1531)
