I wanted to see which modern browser was the fastest on my Mac laptop, but I don't trust out of date benchmarks posted by CNET, and I run beta browsers with a bunch of plugins enabled...some of which can impact performance (like ad blockers).

I've seen all the claims that Safari is better than Chrome, but a claim without data is just a story, and I haven't seen any tests that included the use of plugins. So I ran my own [Web 3 Basemark Tests](http://web.basemark.com/), in a loop loading a specified Gmail folder as well as my reddit home page until my battery died.

Note that I don't consider the total times to be relevant, as these benchmarks push the machine and CPU pretty hard - harder than most do while using the web....**what's important is the difference.**

Each browser had the same set of plugins loaded (1Password, uBlock Origin, Zoom, Amazon Assistant).

Here's my results (totally 100% scientific): 

| Browser | Benchmark Result | Battery Life |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome 69 | 640.97 | 93 min |
| Firefox 62 | 499.94 | 130 min |
| Safari 62 (tech preview) | 609.11 | 161 min |

For me, I will miss a couple of my ancillary (but not super important) plugins from Chrome at the benefit of a significant increase in battery life by moving to Safari.
