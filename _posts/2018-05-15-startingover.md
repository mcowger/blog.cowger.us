I've had some [time recently due to a change in circumstances](https://blog.cowger.us/post/goodbye-always-makes-my-throat-hurt/) to clean up some parts of my personal life.  I've started eating better, working out more, and cleaning up my blog.

To that end, I've moved some old, unrelated to current work  posts out of my primary blog.  You can still find them all in [raw form on Github](https://github.com/mcowger/old_blog/tree/master/_posts).

With it comes a new theme, generator and hosting.  More on that later.
